# Hello, World!

This project is built with React + Vite with TypeScript and Spring Boot with Java 22. I've been studying both, and I just wanted to practice them.

You need to run 'kurth-system-api' in your Java IDE to start the back-end system. Then, execute in the VSCode "yarn dev" to start the front-end.

You can import the 'Kurth.postman_collection.json' and easily make requests with Postman. 

A lot more needs to be done, such as: authentication, tracking the number of likes and replies on posts, optimization of the database system, global event handling in React to prevent refresh on post publishing, exceptions, and more...

If you encounter any bugs or issues, please send me a message at "gabriel.andrade@sptech.school" or open an issue on GitHub.

This is how it should look. Donâ€™t mind the images. It was 2am and this is ridiculous. Comical.
