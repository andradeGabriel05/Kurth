# Hello, World!

You need to run 'kurth-system-api' in your Java IDE to start the back-end system. This project is built with React + Vite with TypeScript and Spring Boot with Java 22. I've been studying both, and I just wanted to practice them.

You can import the 'Kurth.postman_collection.json' and easily make requests with Postman.

A lot more needs to be done, such as: authentication, tracking the number of likes and replies on posts, optimization of the database system, global event handling in React to prevent refresh on post publishing, exceptions, and more...
